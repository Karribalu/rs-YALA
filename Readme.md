# 🧙‍♀️ YALA: Yet Another Lost Amulet

*A Rusty Roguelike Adventure Where One Tavern Oath Starts It All...*

## 📜 The Tale

The village is cursed.

From the deep caverns below, a plague of monsters emerges night after night, laying waste to the world above. The elders whisper of an ancient relic, the **Amulet of YALA** — a long-lost artifact of immense power, capable of sealing the darkness once and for all.

One evening, after *way too much ale* and a very public speech in the local tavern, a reckless hero swears to retrieve the amulet and save the village.

Morning comes. Hungover, underprepared, and wildly overconfident, the hero descends into the dungeon.

Welcome to **YALA: Yet Another Lost Amulet** — a turn-based roguelike full of danger, loot, and the occasional regret.
